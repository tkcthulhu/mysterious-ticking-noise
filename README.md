# mysterious-ticking-noise

This is another C# learning project, getting comfortable with the syntax mainly. A lot of if statements and switch case. This is a basic "Choose your own adventure" style game. With C# being my first statically typed language, these starter projects are super helpful in getting the idea of type saftey down in a simple program where it is easy to narrow down where I made a mistake. Thanks for checking it out!
